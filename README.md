# Prognostic-Predictions-post-Cardiac-Arrest
## 1. Introduction
Cardiac arrest is the most common cause of death in the United States and a major public health problem. Of more than 125,000 comatose patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest each year, nearly half die after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy for perceived poor neurological prognosis (WLST-N). At the same time, most survivors enjoy favorable neurological recovery. When choosing WLST-N, clinicians demand high levels of certainty. Unfortunately, current tools to predict these patientsâ€™ outcomes are inadequate: no clinical findings or tests offer adequate specificity predicting poor outcome for at least 3 days post-arrest, and prognosis often remains uncertain far longer.4 Each year tens of thousands of patients with unrecognized irrecoverable brain injury receive prolonged care at staggering cost. Thousands more have unrecognized recovery potential yet die after misguided WLST-N.2 Improving the speed and accuracy of post-arrest prognostication will save lives, allow appropriate resources to be directed to patients who are likely to benefit, avoid long and difficult care for patients who cannot recover, and spare families the agony of uncertainty.
